  <title>Abstract</title>
  <p>Drug therapy continues to be a pivotal element in the treatment of
  a myriad of medical conditions, and pharmacology has come a long way
  since its early days with empirical treatments with herbalism and has
  evolved into a sophisticated science. This transformative journey
  encapsulates the integration of knowledge spanning from molecular
  biology to large-scale human trials, reflecting the deepening
  understanding of drug action and biological system interactions.</p>
  <p>Despite these advancements, variability in drug efficacy and safety
  continues to pose significant challenges and is also under the
  influence of pathological states such as inflammation. The research
  presented in this thesis delves into the intricate relationship
  between inflammation and drug metabolism, focusing on the modulation
  of drug-metabolizing enzymes within a novel 3D model of primary human
  hepatocytes.</p>
  <p>In the <bold>first study</bold> we wanted to investigate if the
  implementation of a novel 3D model of primary human hepatocytes could
  help bridge the gap of correlation between <italic>in vivo</italic>
  and <italic>in vitro</italic> research and improve translation of
  <italic>in vivo</italic> research on this area. A lack of correlation
  likely due to inherent limitations with the use of the gold standard
  2D model, which is inherently prone to rapid dedifferentiation, and
  the use of supraphysiological concentrations of cytokines. With the
  hope that the 3D model and the use of also more relevant
  concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines we found…</p>
  <p>The <bold>second study</bold> addresses the critical aspect of
  selecting suitable reference genes for relative gene expression using
  qPCR analysis, a key step in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of
  gene expression analysis. Historically, certain genes have been used
  indiscriminately as reference genes, under the assumption of their
  stable expression across different conditions due to their
  ‘housekeeping’ function. However, it has become clear that no single
  gene can or should be universally used as a reference gene, as the
  lack of stability of your reference gene under your experimental
  conditions may have a major impact on the final result. Interestingly,
  we found that most of our chosen genes remained relatively stable
  under our experimental conditions. This stability is likely attributed
  to the careful selection of genes that are minimally affected by
  cytokine treatments or alterations in glucose, ensuring their
  expression remains consistent, and due to uniformity of genetic
  expression in a primary human single cell line.</p>
  <p>In the <bold>third study</bold>, our approach further refines the
  3D model by introducing Kupffer cells, thereby aiming to replicate the
  hepatic microenvironment more accurately. This enhancement is expected
  to simulate a more authentic human inflammatory response. By
  incorporating resident hepatic macrophages, we anticipate a closer
  mimicry of in vivo cytokine profiles and ratios, enabling a better
  understanding of the liver’s response to inflammation. This
  advancement marks a significant step towards creating more reliable
  and representative in vitro models for studying drug metabolism in
  inflammatory conditions.</p>
